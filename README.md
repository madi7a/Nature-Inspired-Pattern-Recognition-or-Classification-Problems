# üß¨ Nature-Inspired Pattern Recognition for Classification Problems

This project explores nature-inspired optimization algorithms for tuning hyperparameters of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We focus on classifying income using the [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset), applying techniques such as:

- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
- Firefly Algorithm
- Two hybrid approaches
- Multiple Streamlit-based interactive dashboards

## üß™ Dataset

We use the [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset), where the task is to classify whether an individual's income exceeds \$50K/year based on census features.
